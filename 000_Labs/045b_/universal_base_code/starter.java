			Create a program that creates a crossword puzzle hiding 1 word given by the user!

			1. Take a word from the user
			2. Create a 2D String array with a size of 5 larger than the word size in both directions
			3. Choose what direction the word should hide in
				- Vertical, Horizontal, Diagonal
				- EXTRA: Choose if the word should hide forward or backwards
			4. For each letter in the word, hide it into a spot in the 2D array
				- This spot should be chosen randomly within the bounds of the 2D array
			5. Once the word is stored in the array, fill up the rest of the array
				- Note what value is stored in the String array and replacing non-filled values with random letters
				- Given the letters array, choose a random letter to populate it with
			6. Print out the crossword puzzle!
			7. Ask a friend to find the word!
